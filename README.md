This contains two basic websites namely, BMI Calculator and Ethereum currency-based e-commerce website.

Firstly BMI calculator which just a basic web-designed code to identify the user's BMI value through height and weight as input. 
If it exceeds or precedes the normal range, then it will show an alert.  

In the second web-based project an Ethereum currency-based e-commerce website where a login, sign up, and main pages are been done a proper payment mode is yet to be done. 
Through meta mask and neoline transactions are done. For now, there is a transaction message that it has been done.
